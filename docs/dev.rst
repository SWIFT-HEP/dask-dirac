Developer's Corner
==================

Development server
------------------

As discussed on `GitHub https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/discussions/6121`_, there is a development server available for DIRAC.
The server has some resources behind it and requires a manual registration to to the CS/Registry of lbcertifdirac70.cern.ch.
The developer needs to be a member of the dteam Virtual Organisation (VO) to be able to use the server.


Production server
----------------
The `production server https://dirac.gridpp.ac.uk:8443/DIRAC/`_ is not yet ready to accept HTML requests.
The necessary upgrade is on the roadmap and this document will be updated when the upgrade is complete.
